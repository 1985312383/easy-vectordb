# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Text-Image Search Fix project aims to repair, improve, and enhance the existing text-image search engine implementation located in `docs/Milvus/project/text_search_pic`. The current system uses CLIP models with Milvus vector database to enable semantic text-to-image search capabilities, but has several critical issues including dependency conflicts, missing data handling, poor error management, and lack of robustness. This project will transform the existing Jupyter notebook implementation into a production-ready, maintainable system with comprehensive error handling, automated setup, and enhanced functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the text-image search system to automatically handle dependency installation and compatibility issues, so that I can set up and run the system without manual intervention or dependency conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is first run THEN it SHALL automatically detect and install all required dependencies including torch, torchvision, towhee, pymilvus, and other necessary packages
2. WHEN dependency conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL resolve them automatically by installing compatible versions
3. WHEN torch/torchvision compatibility issues arise THEN the system SHALL install the correct matching versions
4. IF dependency installation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with manual installation instructions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically download and set up required data and models, so that I can use the text-image search functionality without manual data preparation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts and data directories are missing THEN it SHALL automatically download the required image dataset
2. WHEN the CLIP model is not available locally THEN the system SHALL download it from ModelScope instead of Hugging Face
3. WHEN data download fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative download methods and clear instructions
4. WHEN model files are corrupted or incomplete THEN the system SHALL re-download them automatically
5. WHEN using ModelScope THEN the system SHALL properly configure ModelScope credentials and endpoints for Chinese users

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want robust error handling and graceful degradation, so that the system continues to function even when some components fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Milvus connection fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and provide fallback options
2. WHEN image files are missing or corrupted THEN the system SHALL skip them and continue processing with available images
3. WHEN GPU is not available THEN the system SHALL automatically fall back to CPU processing
4. WHEN memory limitations are encountered THEN the system SHALL reduce batch sizes and optimize memory usage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities, so that I can debug issues and monitor system performance effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation is performed THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about the process
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log complete error traces with context information
3. WHEN processing images THEN the system SHALL report progress and performance metrics
4. WHEN search operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log query details and response times

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want an improved web interface with better user experience, so that I can easily perform text-to-image searches and view results effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter a text query THEN the system SHALL display search progress and estimated completion time
2. WHEN search results are returned THEN they SHALL be displayed with image previews, similarity scores, and metadata
3. WHEN errors occur during search THEN the interface SHALL show user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
4. WHEN the system is loading THEN the interface SHALL show appropriate loading indicators and status messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modular and maintainable code architecture, so that I can easily extend and modify the system functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is structured THEN it SHALL separate concerns into distinct modules for data handling, model management, search operations, and web interface
2. WHEN new features are added THEN they SHALL follow established patterns and interfaces
3. WHEN configuration changes are needed THEN they SHALL be managed through a centralized configuration system
4. WHEN testing is performed THEN each module SHALL have comprehensive unit tests and integration tests

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to support different deployment modes and configurations, so that I can use it in various environments from development to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying in development mode THEN the system SHALL use lightweight configurations and provide detailed debugging information
2. WHEN deploying in production mode THEN the system SHALL optimize for performance and stability
3. WHEN running on different hardware configurations THEN the system SHALL automatically adapt resource usage
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support distributed processing and load balancing

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that I can understand how to use and extend the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the system THEN complete API documentation SHALL be available with usage examples
2. WHEN setting up the system THEN step-by-step installation and configuration guides SHALL be provided
3. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN comprehensive troubleshooting guides SHALL be available
4. WHEN extending functionality THEN developer guides and code examples SHALL be provided
