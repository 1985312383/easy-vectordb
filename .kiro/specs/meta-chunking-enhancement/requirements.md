# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Meta-Chunking Enhancement project aims to improve the existing Meta-Chunking text segmentation system by adding comprehensive code documentation, error handling, performance optimizations, and additional features. The current system implements two text chunking strategies (PPL Chunking and Margin Sampling Chunking) but lacks detailed documentation and robust error handling mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Meta-Chunking system, I want comprehensive code documentation, so that I can understand the system's functionality and make modifications efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL have detailed docstrings for all functions and classes
2. WHEN examining complex algorithms THEN the system SHALL have inline comments explaining the logic
3. WHEN looking at configuration parameters THEN the system SHALL have clear explanations of their purpose and valid ranges
4. WHEN reading the code THEN the system SHALL follow consistent documentation standards throughout

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of the Meta-Chunking system, I want robust error handling, so that the system provides meaningful feedback when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid input is provided THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
2. WHEN model loading fails THEN the system SHALL handle the exception gracefully and inform the user
3. WHEN processing large texts THEN the system SHALL handle memory limitations appropriately
4. WHEN network issues occur during model loading THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms or fallback options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user processing large documents, I want performance monitoring capabilities, so that I can understand processing times and optimize my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing text THEN the system SHALL display processing time information
2. WHEN chunking large documents THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
3. WHEN comparing chunking methods THEN the system SHALL provide performance metrics for each method
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL warn users about potential performance impacts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher using the Meta-Chunking system, I want detailed output information, so that I can analyze the chunking results and understand the decision-making process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chunking is complete THEN the system SHALL display the number of chunks created
2. WHEN using PPL Chunking THEN the system SHALL show perplexity scores for decision points
3. WHEN using Margin Sampling THEN the system SHALL display probability differences for splitting decisions
4. WHEN chunks are created THEN the system SHALL show chunk size statistics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer extending the system, I want modular code structure, so that I can easily add new chunking methods or modify existing ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new chunking methods THEN the system SHALL support plugin-style architecture
2. WHEN modifying existing methods THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility
3. WHEN testing individual components THEN the system SHALL have clear separation of concerns
4. WHEN integrating new features THEN the system SHALL follow established patterns and interfaces

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user working with different text types, I want enhanced language support, so that I can process various document formats effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing different languages THEN the system SHALL automatically detect language when not specified
2. WHEN handling mixed-language documents THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate chunking strategies
3. WHEN working with technical documents THEN the system SHALL preserve code blocks and special formatting
4. WHEN processing structured text THEN the system SHALL respect document hierarchy and sections
